#Dollar Cost Averaging

/collect_sp500.py -> script to collect historic data of the S&P500 index

/graphs.py -> module containing interface functions to create graphs using seaborne library

/simulation.py -> module containing the simulation functions to run the investing simulation on the historic data

=============================================================================================

/return_by_day_10yearly_averaged_sp500.py -> experiment to determine wheter the choice of day for investing monthly has any influence on long term return

Answer:  
No, hereby proving the fact that dollar cost averaging is a simple but effective investing strategy for long term sustainable growth of returns. It is possible to achieve a decent expected return by investing a same amount of dollars every month in a diversified ETF (like for example a derived S&P500 ETF such as SPY which is similar to the ficitiously created S&P500 ETF from the simulation)

This makes it unneccessary to try to wait for the right 'set-up' time to start investing when your goal is long term growth.
